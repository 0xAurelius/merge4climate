          "content": "Merge4Climate is a campaign organized by leaders in the emerging Regenerative Finance (ReFi) space to raise awareness among the wider Ethereum community about the importance of estimating and compensating for the historical emissions of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) era, as well as offsetting residual emissions associated with PoS and key off-chain infrastructure. . Beyond this initial campaign, there is a broader coalition forming, tentatively called ETH4Climate (ETH4C), which will carry on this work, spurring involvement and developing a robust system for tracking contributions under a “Big Tent” approach. Rather than insisting that every participant contribute according to a specific process, the aim is to bring together participants who want to help mitigate Ethereum’s environmental impact with builders who are bringing ecosystem service assets like carbon credits and Renewable Energy Certificates on-chain. .
